app.listen() in Express is like telling your app to start listening for visitors on a specific address and port, much like how Node listens for connections. 
The app, created by `express()`, is just a handy function that handles different types of requests, making it easy to serve both HTTP and HTTPS versions of your app without extra complexity.


// ALL ABOUT MORGAN PACKAGE
Morgan is another HTTP request logger middleware for Node. js. It simplifies the process of logging requests to your application.
The Morgan package in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack is actually a middleware for Express.js. It helps with logging HTTP requests, making it easier to debug and analyze server-side activities. 
Morgan logs information about incoming requests, such as the HTTP method, URL, status code, response time, and more.
It's a handy tool during development to keep track of what's happening in your backend. 
You can customize the logging format and choose whether to log to the console, a file, or another destination. 
It's not necessary for the basic functioning of your MERN app, but it's a useful addition for debugging and monitoring purposes.
